This project -- a simple index page with links to different recipes -- will demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML. I'll be logging my work on GitHub as I go and will update this page at the conclusion of the project with a summary of what I built and learned.

UPDATE: I built a simple cooking website with a homepage and three recipe pages, each of which contains an image, a description, and ordered and unordered lists. The homepage links to all three recipe pages, and the recipe pages link back to the homepage. The project was fairly straightforward, but I had fun building out the content. I focused on committing all significant changes to GitHub and keeping my code clean and clear.
